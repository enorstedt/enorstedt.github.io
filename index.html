	<H1><b>GOOOOOOOO DAWGSSSSSSSS!</b></h1>
	<p>I remember my first dawgs game. It was on November 22nd 2008 and was something special. UGA was playing Arizona State. Matthew Stafford was quarterback at this time and Knowshon Moreno was running back. Together they have helping UGA up to 3rd racked nationally. Marc Richt was still the coach and doing a great job.  It was the second quarter that I remember most. Georgia was at the 15-yard line getting ready to finish a drive with a touchdown. The obvious option was to run the ball with Knowshon. The ball is snapped Stafford pitches it to Knowshon. He follows the blocks and rubs right, through the gaps. It looks like be might get stop short of the end zone as it would take a miracle to get past the Arizona State defense. Then a miracle came. Knowshon took one look at the end zone and leaped from the 6-yard line. His right arm outstretched to reach the ball into the end zone. He soared into the end zone, it was an unbelievable sight. He scored the first UGA touchdown I ever saw. That is when I knew I was a Dawg for life. </p>
